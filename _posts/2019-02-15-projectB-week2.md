For my 2nd project I choose Figma to design prototypes of e-commerce website in mobile version.I have particulary choosen Figma because i have trouble making mock ups for my recent projects.It was difficult to share my work easily withj the team members.so,Figma interested me.
Problems:
This was the learning .I just researched about the software.
## this week
I have seen some online videos to get familier with the application, to get to know about the various features of the application.I have watched some online tutorials about the Figma.I have used few tools of the figma to design some sample prototypes.
## next week
* i will explore interface of the software.
* i will design the prototype for the next week.
* I will start working on the homepage and the cart page of the website.
