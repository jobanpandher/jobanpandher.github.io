I like animations and designing thats why I choose logo animation using After Effects and in future it will help me in my project works to apply animations on logo or even on text.
This week I have created a logo for animation on illustrator related to my project that is health.
I have learned how to use the tools in after effects and how to apply animations on the logo and text like card wipe, 3D rotation, light sweep
By following some tutorials I tried to apply animations on a logo.
Next week I will create 2 more logo 
After that I will search more tools and learned how to used them and apply animations on logo
