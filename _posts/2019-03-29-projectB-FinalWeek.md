[ Project B_FinalReport ]({% post_url 2019-03-29-projectB-FinalWeek %})

## This week
I have done prototyping and made some changes to the typography.
I prepared the presentation.

## Evaluation
I have successfully met my decision as I have decided to create the prototypes of e-commerce website. 
I have followed various tutorials and websites to learn various tools of figma. I have completed 
my project on time and explored the software, how to use it. I have learned various tools to
create design and prototypes.

## Lessons Learn
I learned how to design the prototypes and how the user can interact with these prototypes. 
I have used components, grid system, constraints, instance. I learned different prototyping 
option like overlay menu, swap and navigate and came to know how to make impressive prototypes 
by applying transition and trigger options.


## Unexpected Challenges
In the beginning I faced many problems related to tools like components and how to detach instance. 
I faced some problems in grid layout. In prototyping I faced problems in overlay position and swap position. 
I followed some tutorials to overcome these problems.

## Future Scope
Figma is very useful for creating prototypes of websites and it is a team-based application. 
We can share our work with our team members and make changes at the same time. It is good 
software when we are working with our team because each team member can see the changes made by others.
